# This file contains the allowed analyzer rule "Category" and corresponding "Diagnostic ID range"
# FORMAT:
# 'Category': Comma separate list of 'StartId-EndId' or 'Id' or 'Prefix'

#
# The ranges below represent the **currently used IDs** for the corresponding category.
# When implementing a new rule for the category, BEFORE submitting a PR:
#   1. Choose the rule ID immediately following the range end.
#   2. Update the range end to the chosen rule ID.
#   3. Commit and push the change to this file to `main`, with this file being the only file in the commit.
#   4. Your rule ID is now reserved and can be used in your PR.
#
# In the event of conflict in step 3, make sure you discard your changes, pull latest, and try again.
# DO NOT remove ID ranges already defined or merge this file in git.
