.SYNOPSIS
    Helper script to download and run the Apache Release Audit Tool (RAT).

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates use of the Apache RAT tool during release preparation.
    It ensures that the RAT JAR is available locally (downloading it if needed)
    and then runs it against the source tree to check for missing license headers
    and other compliance issues.

    By default, the tool is downloaded into a `.tools/rat` directory located next
    to this script. The script always runs RAT with the repository root (same
    directory as this script) as the target directory.

.PARAMETER Version
    The version of Apache RAT to use (default: 0.13).

.PARAMETER ExcludeFileName
    Name of an exclude file containing path patterns that RAT should ignore.
    This file should be located next to the script. Default: rat-exclude.txt

.REQUIREMENTS
    - Java 8+ must be installed and available on the PATH.
    - Internet connection (for first run, to download RAT).

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh ./rat.ps1

    Runs Apache RAT (default version 0.13) with exclusions from `rat-exclude.txt`.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh ./rat.ps1 -Version 0.13 -ExcludeFileName custom-exclude.txt

    Runs Apache RAT version 0.13 using the specified exclude file.

.NOTES
    This script is intended for use by release managers when preparing official
    ASF releases. It is not normally required for day-to-day development.
